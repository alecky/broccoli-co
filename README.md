I have added labels to each of the fields in order to make the more accessible. If i had more time i would also have added focus states to the fields on error.

Ive added a close x as well as closing the model on the modal overlay screen.

In order to prevent having to zoom ive added font sizes based on the screen width.

I had difficulty reading the referene images to ive added placholder text or made it up.
